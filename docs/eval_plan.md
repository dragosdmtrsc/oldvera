Evaluation Plan
===============

### Router models:

- naive if/else chain
- if/else with per-port grouping of constraints
- fork
- fork with fancy-MAT sourced constraints

#### Measurements:

- time to compile model
- symb. exec. time with symbolic packet
- symb. exec. time with concrete packet
- time to update model when insert
- _delta?_
